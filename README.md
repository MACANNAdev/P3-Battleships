## How to play


 This game is based on the classic battleship game.

 The program generates two random boards, one for the player and one for
  computer.

 Both boards then also have the location of there ships randomly generated
 with the computers ships not being revealed to the player

 The player then inputs co-ordinates to guess the location of the computer's ship and the 
 computer guesses through a randomly generated number.

 If either player hits, the board will be updated with a * in the location the guess was made.
 If either player missess, the board will be updated with a X in the location the guess was made.

 when a player hits all the ships the player wins!!!

## Testing
### Code Validation

The PEP8  Service was used to validate the project.

-   [PYTHON Validator](http://pep8online.com/) - [Results](images/pep8.png)
     
     


## Deployment

This project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku:

   1. Fork or clone this repository

   2. Create a new Heroku app
   
   3. Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS in that order

   4. Link the Heroku app to the repository

   5. click on Deploy
